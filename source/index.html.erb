title: "Hello there,"
intro: |
  I am a front-end developer based in Bordeaux, France. The main focus of my work is to build accessible, inclusive and user-friendly web interfaces. Since April 2021, I co-founded <a href="https://slash-tmp.dev">/tmp</a>, a company specialized in web accessibility and web development. You can find some of my work on <a href="https://github.com/bellangerq" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com/bellanger_q" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Otherwise I am a minimalist and I enjoy gaming, eSports, writing and hiking. Here are some of my blog posts.
